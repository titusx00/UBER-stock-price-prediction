# UBER-stock-price-model
In this project, I developed an LSTM-based forecasting model that predicts the closing price of Uber Technologies, Inc. using a 60-day window of historical price data.
The analysis includes data processing, visualization of price trends, and a comparison between predicted and actual prices to evaluate model performance. 
The project demonstrates my interest in capital markets and my ability to apply quantitative methods to real financial data.
